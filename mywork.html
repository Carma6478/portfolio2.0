                                <p>Farmers in the Philippines still remain the poorest citizen of the country and
                                    is facing a food security crisis. A large portion of the citizens living in rural
                                    areas supports themselves with agricultural activities and a quarter of the Filipino
                                    employee also works in the agriculture sector. Aside from the fact that it provides employment
                                    , Agriculture has a huge impact to providing food and affects the country's Economy.
                                    With that said, DC Aeroponics Company proposes an indoor gardening IOT based Aeroponics
                                    system to address food security problem by increasing the food output through easily
                                    grown and harvested crops within each household. It also solves the problem of farmers
                                    in terms of using spaces because it uses less space than the traditional farming.
                                    The crops that will be produce is also in an enclosed environment meaning the crops
                                    won't be contaminated by outside variables. Whats more exciting in this product,
                                    it only uses misting system with nutrients in it in order to produce the high yielding
                                    crops meaning the vegetable that you will be getting will come from a soil less planting. <a href="https://dlsaraneta-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/kristoffer_capuras_dlsau_edu_ph/EaHMCQsdVFlAjorkzNI-vIQBAz7VJvqs6Ld_KCvrPb9Eng?e=TLXG44">Click here to See More!</a>

                                <h1 class="sub-title">SMART WATER VALVE SYSTEM FOR URBAN GREEN HYDROPONIC SYSTEM</h1>
                                <p>“Removing Human Error” this is the main problem that we wanted to solve. Many of the maintenance crew on Urban green seldomly forget to open some of the water systems
                                    in the Gutters in their Hydroponic system when they are doing maintenance on it, and with that even if it’s just 1 water valve that is left closed, a whole layer of plants is in verge of dying in that process and that
                                    would be a hundred of plants that will not be sold for that reason only. With that, Urban Greens CEO Ralph
                                    Becker, assigned us his engineering Interns to think for a solution that would help Urban Greens in Reducing
                                    Human error. We have proposed a Smart Valve system with Blynk Application for monitoring and control, that is an Arduino based automation which we think that would solve the problem. The System is an Automated System incorporated with IoT. 
                                    We used Arduino UNO as the brain for our operation on Automation that will be use in order for the system to work. The system is connected to Blynk application so that any of the of the users who has access on
                                    the application, or the system, can monitor or control what they want to do on the system. We used C language on programming 
                                    the system, with this any of the user who have small knowledge on the C language programming can modify the system on how they want it to work. <a href="https://dlsaraneta-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/kristoffer_capuras_dlsau_edu_ph/ERGgVl1YfaJPs_rOTzxn9t8BTVeqUfx75JTz9j1HEWvPiw?e=AcXB5D"> Click here to See More!</a>

                                <p> It started on May 17, where i thought of exploring coding and to do some projects.
                                    HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT is the first things that come out on my search bar when 
                                    i search for somethings to do with projects, and thats why i practiced making some
                                    Web site just for fun and to learn some stuffs. At first i made a Website for our 
                                    Aeroponics System. then i also made another one for our Small Valorant 
                                    community with friends. and last is my first portfolio which is indeed lacking but
                                    i made it with just my knowledge with html and css without any youtube guides for beginners. <a href="https://carma6478.github.io/Portfolio-1.0/">Click here to See More!</a>
